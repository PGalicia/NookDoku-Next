# NookDoku
_Currently working on v1 release_

### Description:
A trivia-like web application that tests your knowledge about the Animal Crossing intellectual property. This app uses NookiPedia API to grab animal crossing villager's information

(Check it out)[https://nook-doku-next.vercel.app/]

### How It Works:
Similar to grid-based games such as PokeDoku or HoopGrids, you need to find answer that fits the category. Let's say that there's a cell in the grid with the categories of Penguin and Jock for example. You need to find a villager that is in penguin species and has a jock personality (in this example, one answer would be Roald). In the case, you got stuck, there is also a hint system

The app also records all of your answers just to see which villagers you usually pick (aka your favorites)
